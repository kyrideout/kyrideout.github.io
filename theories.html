      Speculate Theories

    <p class="text"> Let’s explore some of the most common theories surrounding the death of Jesus using the four minimal facts we just discussed. Any relevant theory must be able to fully explain these four basic facts. Click on each of the four facts and see how they are supported by each theory.

    <div class="theory">

      <p id="t">Theory #1: Conspiracy </p>
      <p class="text"> What if the disciples invented the whole thing as a conspiracy? They came to the tomb, got around the guards, stole the body and lied about it to the whole world. <p>

          <p class="text">The disciples stole the body, which explains the empty tomb. </p>

            <p id="tt"> Postmortem Appearances </p>
          </div>
          <p class="text">In this theory the disciples lie about seeing Jesus. They know that they stole the body of Jesus and that he is actually still dead.  </p>

            <p id="tt"> Birth of the Church </p>
          </div>
          <p class="text">This theory, however, can’t account for the birth of the church. If we look into the lives of the disciples, we see that all but one of Jesus’ close friends were martyred for trying to spread the story that Jesus rose from the dead. If these men knew that they whole thing was a hoax, why would every single one of them be willing to give up their social status, family and friends, and even their lives, for a lie that gave them no personal benefit?   </p>
