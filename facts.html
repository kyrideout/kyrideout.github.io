    Gather the Facts
  </div>
  <p id="text">       Gathering the objective facts can be tricky, as with any event in history there can be contrasting evidence, and some claims are not recognized by everyone to be fact. To be completely fair in this assessment we will not use the Bible as a historical document and we will only consider claims that are virtually unattested by historians, Christian or not. Each fact that not at least 95% of scholars believe it to be true was thrown out. Following this criteria we arrive at a list of 12 facts that detail the actual events that occurred surrounding the death of Jesus. </p>

  <p id="text"> Any theory we consider to be true must be able to account for all these facts. However, to be even more lenient, we will only consider the four most central facts. </p>
